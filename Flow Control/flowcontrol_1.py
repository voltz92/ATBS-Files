# flow control python

# boolean = True or False

# comparison operators: 
# == Equal to 
# != Not equal to
# < less than
# > greater than
# <= less than or equal to
# >= greater than or equal to 

# these operators result in boolean values

print(42 < 32)  # >> False
print(42 != 32)  # >> True
print(43 >= 32) # >> True

#floats and ints can be equal to each other though strings that include numbers evaluate to false

# boolean operators >> 'and' 'or' 'not'
# you know about them. they are pretty much the same
